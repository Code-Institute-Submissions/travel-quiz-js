<h1>Travel Quiz</h1>

<p>This site is a fully interative and responsive travel quiz, to help the user
decide on where is best to travel dependant on their specific wants and needs 
at that time. Once answered a comprehensive set of questions, they will be given 
a tailored recommendation for a destination, and more information as of where this place is
on Google maps. I am also looking to include links to a flight and accomodation
comparison sites.</p>

<h2>Why is this project unique?</h2>
<p>There are many accomodation and flight comparison sites out there, but you need to know
the destination prior to researching. There are also quizzes out there to help you make a 
decision on your destination. As far as I can see there is not a site to combine all the 
neccessary steps to travel, from researching the best place for you, to booking your trip.
As you can see in the `Releases` section, the amount and specificity of the questions will 
increase and therefore the quiz will be unique within itself.</p>

<h2>UX</h2>

<h3>Project Goals</h3>
<p>To provide an efficient way to help a user find there ideal travel destination
without having to to lots of research into their requirements. Also to provide
more information on that destination to aid with the follow up research needed.</p>
